# Identifying Residue-Level BPA Crosslinks
Here we use search results from Kojak and PeptideProphet in the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline to identify and visualize residue-level BPA crosslinks.
## Trans-Proteomic Pipeline Tools Used
For more information on the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline tools used see http://www.tppms.org/
## Files
+ `BPA Crosslink Histogram from Kojak Results.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to containing code
+ `Dbase.txt` Example of input file containing search database
+ `kojakresult.txt` Example of input file containing Kojak results
+ `peptideprophetresults.csv` Example of input file containing PeptideProphet validated results
+ `senserror.csv` Example of input file containing PeptideProphet sensitivity error table
  
How to generate each of the input files is described in the Jupyter Notebook
